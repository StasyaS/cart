                <p>
                    The CARTA Registrar, Deputy Registrar and Registration Committee will process and issue all decisions on all applications for registration
                    in a timely manner. If you have graduated more than 6 months ago you are an experienced practitioner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After receiving a complete application, decisions will be issued within the prescribed maximum time limits by any international, national, or provincial authority.
                </p>

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        6 months pursuant with section 6 of the Fair Registration Practices Act in Alberta,

                <p>
                    The College cannot accept any documents (paper, electronic, or fax) from individuals until they have started the online application process.
                    Until an application is made, the College will securely destroy any unsolicited documentation. Once the application
                    has been started the college can accept electronic copies of transcripts. All other documentation must be sent to the office in a trackable envelope.

                <h3>College Goals</h3>
                <p>
                    Our primary goals are to protect the public and the public interest by conducting comprehensive due diligence exercises required to determine that all
                    applicants meet all the registration requirements pursuant with the Respiratory Therapists Profession Regulation in an objective, fair, transparent, and timely manner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Given the mandatory registration section 46 of the Act we recognize that employment is contingent on receiving a practice permit and we make every attempt
                    to issue permits within a reasonable period of time after receiving a complete application.
                </p>

                <h3>Contents of Electronic Confirmation of Application</h3>
                <p>
                    After submitting an online application for registration all applicants will receive an automated electronic mail notification
                    that contains a checklist of all of the documents that must be submitted by the applicant (no exceptions).
                    It is the responsibility of the applicant to know what documents they have submitted to support their application.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Processing Applications
                </h4>
                <p>
                    <strong>We cannot provide any guidance with confidence regarding individual application processing times.</strong>
                    Internal processing when possible is typically performed on a first come first served basis.
                    Exceptions frequently occur which impact processing applications such as staggered graduation
                    dates for cohorts of students, time taken by applicants to collect and submit the documentation,
                    time taken by applicants to follow the electronic mail instructions from CARTA etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once all the required documentation is received, the applications are considered to be complete and
                    the times in which the legislation expects you to receive a decision will be established.
                    Typically, the CARTA can process all documentation within 2 business days of receipt if the applicant
                    follows all the electronic mail instructions.
                </p>

                <h3>How will the Public and Employers Know I am Registered?</h3>
                <p>
                    The CARTA website contains an <a href="#">online register</a> for regulated members on the provisional and general registers. It displays the regulated member’s first name, last name, registration number whether you are provisional or active on the general register and whether conditions exist on the permit or not only. No details about conditions are displayed on the website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Employers are encouraged to ask to inspect practice permits of new employees and frequently ask for it as part of their new employee onboarding procedures.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once CARTA confirms remittance of your $425.00 credit card payment for registration fees your name will display on the website and a practice permit will be emailed to you. You can also download a PDF of your permit through the Members section of the website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>It is very important to inform the CARTA Registrar by electronic mail if your mailing address changes after submitting an application for registration</strong>. Incorrect addresses (e.g., no postal code) may contribute to delays in receiving your practice permit (license to practice).
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you inspect the register on the website and haven’t received your practice permit after 7 days of viewing your name on the website, please e-mail the registrar using request practice permit in the subject line.
                </p>
